# ME495 Robot Design Studio - Skateboard Team

This is a directory of the code that is used to program the Tiva microcontroller for the Skateboard Team of Robot Design Studio 2020.

Since each member of the team has different Makefiles, different folders contain code that only works on a specific computer. This is why each folder name contains a name of a team member.

## Folders
###BNO_drivers -- Bosch Sensortec BNO055 sensor driver library
IMU_sparkfun_chris -- Streams data from SparkFun IMU (LSM9DS1)
bosch_michael -- an attempt at getting the Bosch IMU to communicate with the Tiva
encoder_chris -- Communication between encoder and Tiva
accelerometer_chris -- Chris's version of accelerometer data retrieval
accelerometer_jake --  Jake's version of accelerometer data retrieval
hello_world_*  --  Multiple hello_worlds created by different team members
