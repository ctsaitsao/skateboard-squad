# ME 495 Robot Design Studio, Skateboard Team

This is a directory of the code that is used to program the Tiva microcontroller for the Skateboard Team of Robot Design Studio 2020. 

Since each member of the team has different Makefiles, different folders contain code that only works on a specific computer. This is why each folder name contains a name of a team member.
