%% update_events.m

% Description:
%   function that computes the 4x1 vector of data from which events are
%   detected
%
% Inputs:
%   x: the 10x1 vector of states
%   F_active: the active forces as computed by robot_dynamics
%   params: a struct with many elements, generated by calling init_params.m
%
% Outputs:
%   events: a 2x1 vector in which each element is either a constraint
%   equation value or a constraint force value
